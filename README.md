pfsvm considering TU information and harris
when I made this project, I only use TU info wheather here is in block or block boundary.
At Jan 3rd, I modify to consider block corner and block boundary gradient processing.
Idk wheather this program run correctly, since I go back my labo, I should check.
After that, I upload again.
